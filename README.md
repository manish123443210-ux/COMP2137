# System Information Report

This repository contains a Bash script `system_report.sh` that generates a clean, human-readable system report suitable for your course submission.

## How to run

```bash
chmod +x system_report.sh
./system_report.sh
```

The report includes OS, uptime, CPU, RAM, disk models/sizes, GPU, host IP, gateway, DNS, user sessions, disk free space, process count, load averages, listening ports, and UFW status. The script avoids noisy errors and works across common Linux distros.
